		<h1>Full V-up</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Contract your abdominal muscles and core slowly and lift your legs up to an extended position at a 45-degree angle with your torso.
      2. Reach your arms straight forward or reach up toward your shins as you are able. It's important to maintain good core posture and a strong spine throughout the movement and to avoid rounding the shoulders forward. Don't hold your breath—continue to breathe deeply during the movement.<br>
      3. Hold this V-shaped position for several seconds to begin. As you get stronger, hold the position longer.<br>
      4. Return to your starting position slowly while continuing to keep your abs engaged and tight.<br>
      5. Just before you reach the floor, stop and hold the position for a few seconds.<br>
      6. Repeat.

		<h1>Side Abs</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Start in a side forearm plank: Support yourself on one forearm with your legs outstretched, feet stacked, and hips lifted. Hold your top arm behind your head.<br>
      2. Bend top leg and raise it to meet the same elbow while keeping your body stable in a straight line. Bring leg and arm back to the starting position in a steady, controlled motion.<br>
      3. Don’t forget to even yourself out! Roll to the other side to complete a matching set of side plank crunches.

		<h1>Plank</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Begin on all fours, placing your hands on the ground directly beneath your shoulders.<br>
            2. Next, step your feet behind you, grounding down into your toes to form a straight line from head to toe.<br>
            3. Engage your legs, glutes, and core as you maintain a neutral neck and spine.<br>
            4. Hold for 30 seconds with good form.
