		<h1>Push Up</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. With your legs extended back, place the hands below the shoulders, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.<br>
      2. Start bending your elbows and lower your chest until it’s just above the floor.<br>
      3. Push back to the starting position. A 1-second push, 1-second pause, 2-second down count is ideal.<br>
      4. Repeat.

		<h1>Crunch</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Lie down on the floor on your back and bend your knees, placing your hands behind your head or across your chest. Some people find that crossing the arms over the chest helps them avoid pulling on the neck. However, if you find your neck is strained, you can keep one hand cradling the head. If you are putting your hands behind your head, your fingers should gently cradle your head. The idea is to support your neck without taking away from the work of your abs.<br>
      2. Pull your belly button towards your spine in preparation for the movement.<br>
      3. Slowly contract your abdominals, bringing your shoulder blades about 1 or 2 inches off the floor.<br>
      4. Exhale as you come up and keep your neck straight, chin up. Imagine you're holding a tennis ball under your chin. That's about the angle you want to keep the chin the entire time.<br>
      5. Hold at the top of the movement for a few seconds, breathing continuously.<br>
      6. Slowly lower back down, but don't relax all the way.<br>
      7. Repeat.

		<h1>Plank Rotation</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Start in a side plank position, with your right shoulder over your elbow, your body in a straight line, and reach your left hand toward the ceiling.<br>
            2. Twist your torso forward and slowly place your left arm under your body.<br>
            3. Repeat and then switch sides.

		<h1>Plank</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Begin on all fours, placing your hands on the ground directly beneath your shoulders.<br>
            2. Next, step your feet behind you, grounding down into your toes to form a straight line from head to toe.<br>
            3. Engage your legs, glutes, and core as you maintain a neutral neck and spine.<br>
            4. Hold for 30 seconds with good form.

		<h1>Side Abs</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Start in a side forearm plank: Support yourself on one forearm with your legs outstretched, feet stacked, and hips lifted. Hold your top arm behind your head.<br>
      2. Bend top leg and raise it to meet the same elbow while keeping your body stable in a straight line. Bring leg and arm back to the starting position in a steady, controlled motion.<br>
      3. Don’t forget to even yourself out! Roll to the other side to complete a matching set of side plank crunches.
