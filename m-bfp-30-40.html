		<h1>Squat</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Stand with feet a little wider than hip width, toes facing front.<br>
			2. Drive your hips backâ€”bending at the knees and ankles and pressing your knees slightly open.<br>
			3. Sit into a squat position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground, chest up and shoulders back.<br>
			4. Strive to eventually reach parallel, meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle.<br>
			5. Press into your heels and straighten legs to return to a standing upright position.

		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Place the knees on the floor, the hands below the shoulders, and cross your feet.<br>

		<h1>Crunch</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Lie down on the floor on your back and bend your knees, placing your hands behind your head or across your chest. Some people find that crossing the arms over the chest helps them avoid pulling on the neck. However, if you find your neck is strained, you can keep one hand cradling the head. If you are putting your hands behind your head, your fingers should gently cradle your head. The idea is to support your neck without taking away from the work of your abs.<br>
            2. Pull your belly button towards your spine in preparation for the movement.<br>
            3. Slowly contract your abdominals, bringing your shoulder blades about 1 or 2 inches off the floor.<br>
            4. Exhale as you come up and keep your neck straight, chin up. Imagine you're holding a tennis ball under your chin. That's about the angle you want to keep the chin the entire time.<br>
            5. Hold at the top of the movement for a few seconds, breathing continuously.<br>
            6. Slowly lower back down, but don't relax all the way.<br>
            7. Repeat.

		<h1>Side Plank <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);">|Please do the both sides.</mark></h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Start on your side with your feet together and one forearm directly below your shoulder.<br>
            2. Contract your core and raise your hips until your body is in a straight line from head to feet.<br>
            3. Hold the position without letting your hips drop for the allotted time for each set, then repeat on the other side.

		<h1>Plank</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Begin on all fours, placing your hands on the ground directly beneath your shoulders.<br>
            2. Next, step your feet behind you, grounding down into your toes to form a straight line from head to toe.<br>
            3. Engage your legs, glutes, and core as you maintain a neutral neck and spine.<br>
            4. Hold for 30 seconds with good form.
